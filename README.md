# Income Prediction Workshop

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`census_income_workshop.ipynb`) that implements a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 based on the Census Income (Adult) dataset. The project follows a structured approach, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Overview

The core objective of this workshop is to build and train a neural network using **PyTorch** for a classification task on tabular data. The notebook performs the following key steps:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleans the raw data and handles missing values.
- Separates features into **categorical** and **continuous** types.
- Preprocesses the data by encoding categorical variables and standardizing continuous ones.
- Converts the data into **PyTorch tensors**.
- Splits the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.

### 2. Model Design
- Defines a custom `TabularModel` class using `PyTorch`'s `nn.Module`.
- Incorporates **embeddings** for categorical features.
- Applies **batch normalization** for continuous features.
- Adds a hidden layer with **dropout** for regularization.

### 3. Training & Evaluation
- Trains the model for **300 epochs** using:
  - **CrossEntropyLoss**
  - **Adam optimizer**
- Evaluates the performance on the **test set**, reporting:
  - Final **loss**
  - **Accuracy**

### 4. Prediction Function (Bonus)
- Includes an optional function to allow a user to input new data.
- Provides **real-time predictions** from the trained model.
